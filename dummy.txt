1. Constructors in Scala

In Scala, there are two types of constructors:

Primary constructor

Auxiliary constructor (secondary)



---

🔹 Primary Constructor

The class parameters themselves act as the primary constructor.

class Student(name: String, age: Int) {
  def display(): Unit = {
    println(s"Name: $name, Age: $age")
  }
}

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val s = new Student("Kalai", 21)
    s.display()
  }
}

🧠 The constructor parameters (name, age) are automatically part of the primary constructor.


---

🔹 Auxiliary Constructor

You can define additional constructors using def this(...).

class Student(name: String, age: Int) {
  def this(name: String) = {
    this(name, 18)  // calls primary constructor
  }

  def show() = println(s"$name, $age")
}

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val s1 = new Student("Kalai", 21)
    val s2 = new Student("Sahana") // uses auxiliary
    s1.show()
    s2.show()
  }
}


---

🧍 2. Singleton Objects

Scala does not have “static” members like Java.
Instead, it uses singleton objects — objects that have only one instance in the entire program.


---

🔹 Example

object College {
  def showCollege(): Unit = {
    println("Welcome to ABC College")
  }
}

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    College.showCollege()  // directly call using object name
  }
}

🧠 Here, College is a singleton object — you don’t need new to access it.


---

🔄 3. Companion Objects

A companion object is an object that has the same name as a class.
It can access private members of that class.


---

🔹 Example

class Student(private val name: String, private val age: Int) {
  def display() = println(s"$name is $age years old.")
}

object Student {  // companion object
  def createStudent(n: String, a: Int): Student = new Student(n, a)
}

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val s = Student.createStudent("Kalai", 21)
    s.display()
  }
}

🧠 class Student and object Student are companions — they share access to private data.


---

🧵 4. Threads in Scala

Scala uses Java’s thread support via the Thread class or Runnable interface.


---

🔹 Method 1: Extending Thread Class

class MyThread extends Thread {
  override def run(): Unit = {
    for (i <- 1 to 5)
      println(s"Thread running: $i")
  }
}

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val t1 = new MyThread()
    t1.start()
  }
}


---

🔹 Method 2: Implementing Runnable

class MyRunnable extends Runnable {
  def run(): Unit = {
    for (i <- 1 to 5)
      println(s"Runnable thread: $i")
  }
}

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val r = new MyRunnable()
    val t = new Thread(r)
    t.start()
  }
}

🧠 start() → creates a new thread
run() → defines what the thread executes.


---

🧩 5. Abstract Classes

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and can have both abstract and concrete methods.


---

🔹 Example

abstract class Animal {
  def sound(): Unit   // abstract method
  def sleep(): Unit = println("Sleeping...") // concrete method
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  def sound(): Unit = println("Bark!")
}

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val d = new Dog()
    d.sound()
    d.sleep()
  }
}

🧠 abstract keyword means the class must be extended before use.
